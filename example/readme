The entire project needs flask installed and a few plugins for login forms and redirection
all the css files are in /example/static
and html in /example/templates
 
if you open the example.py in /var/www/html/example, you will find all the html files i am actually using
the login is  login.html
then there is a base.html which is imported in all the pages and consists of only 2 links - home and login
then landing page it is home.html

the one with a table for vault is buyhandshake.html or just handshake.html
